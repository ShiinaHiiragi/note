/-- `match` performs case analysis on one or more expressions.
See [Induction and Recursion][tpil4].
The syntax for the `match` tactic is the same as term-mode `match`, except that
the match arms are tactics instead of expressions.
```
example (n : Nat) : n = n := by
  match n with
  | 0 => rfl
  | i+1 => simp
```

The tactic
```
intro
| pat1 => tac1
| pat2 => tac2
```
is the same as:
```
intro x
match x with
| pat1 => tac1
| pat2 => tac2
```
That is, `intro` can be followed by match arms and it introduces the values while
doing a pattern match. This is equivalent to `fun` with match arms in term mode.

/--
`decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p`
and then reducing that instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`.
If it reduces to `isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

Limitations:
- The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables.
  If there are local variables, you can try first using the `revert` tactic with these local variables
  to move them into the target, which may allow `decide` to succeed.
- Because this uses kernel reduction to evaluate the term, `Decidable` instances defined
  by well-founded recursion might not work, because evaluating them requires reducing proofs.
  The kernel can also get stuck reducing `Decidable` instances with `Eq.rec` terms for rewriting propositions.
  These can appear for instances defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`).
  To avoid this, use definitions such as `decidable_of_iff` instead.

## Examples

Proving inequalities:
```lean
example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide
```

Trying to prove a false proposition:
```lean
example : 1 ≠ 1 := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' proved that the proposition
  1 ≠ 1
is false
-/
```

Trying to prove a proposition whose `Decidable` instance fails to reduce
```lean
opaque unknownProp : Prop

open scoped Classical in
example : unknownProp := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' failed for proposition
  unknownProp
since its 'Decidable' instance reduced to
  Classical.choice ⋯
rather than to the 'isTrue' constructor.
-/
```

## Properties and relations

For equality goals for types with decidable equality, usually `rfl` can be used in place of `decide`.
```lean
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by decide
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by rfl
```
-/
@[builtin_tactic_parser] def decide := leading_parser
  nonReservedSymbol "decide"

/-- `native_decide` will attempt to prove a goal of type `p` by synthesizing an instance
of `Decidable p` and then evaluating it to `isTrue ..`. Unlike `decide`, this
uses `#eval` to evaluate the decidability instance.

This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler to the trusted
part, and the axiom `ofReduceBool` will show up in `#print axioms` for theorems using
this method or anything that transitively depends on them. Nevertheless, because it is
compiled, this can be significantly more efficient than using `decide`, and for very
large computations this is one way to run external programs and trust the result.
```
example : (List.range 1000).length = 1000 := by native_decide
```
-/
@[builtin_tactic_parser] def nativeDecide := leading_parser
  nonReservedSymbol "native_decide"

builtin_initialize
  register_parser_alias "matchRhsTacticSeq" matchRhs

end Tactic
end Parser
end Lean
